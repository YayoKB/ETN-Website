## 💼 Project Brief

> A local small- to mid-size enterprise (SME) would like to have a web page and mobile app developed to advertise their business, receive requests for information from potential customers as well as provide quotes to the potential customers for services requested.

# Technical details

## 🖥️ Tech stack used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript (ES6+)

## ❔ Why we used this stack:

This group project formed part of the Work Integrated Learning module where we had to showcase what we have learnt in other modules. As we had taken a Web Development module the previous semester, we made use of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## 🤓 What I learned

- This was my second venture into developing a website, so while I didn't learn too many new things, I did find myself spending far less time developing the site as compared to my first site.
- This was my first time receiving code from another person and having to implement features/styling based on their code.
- I learned about working in a group, collaborating, the importance of good communication and time management.

## 🙃 What I struggled with

- I could have been more clear with my requests and suggestions of what people could do. This lack of clarity resulted in a team member having to do more work than they needed to, and this resulted in having to spend quite some time making changes.
- I don't know if I would count this as a struggle, but I ended up pulling an all-nighter combined with a non-stop 7-hour-long session adding features last-minute. So, my time management could be better, but this was also a consequence of the previous "mistake".
- I tend to be a perfectionist, so I worried that my constant request for changes, features and fixes could have been annoying or frustrating to my team members.
